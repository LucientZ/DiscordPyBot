# DiscordPyBot
This is a small discord bot that has basic functionality.
This bot was initially in JavaScript, but is currently being converted to python.

This bot uses the discord.py api in which the documentation can be found here:
    https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html


Notes:
    The bot will prompt the user for a token. This token is used for login and verification purposes on the discord client.
    The token is stored in a .token file. Temporary login is an option that is prompted, but this isn't recommended since discord tokens are only able to be viewed once on the devportal.
