# DiscordPyBot
This is a small discord bot that has basic functionality.

Everything here is run in Python 3.8.10 which can be found here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

This bot uses the discord.py api in which the documentation can be found here:
    https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html
    To install: pip install discord.py


Notes:
    The bot will prompt the user for a token. This token is used for login and verification purposes on the discord client.
    The token is stored in a .token file. Temporary login is an option that is prompted, but this isn't recommended since discord tokens are only able to be viewed once on the devportal.

    Some commands are requests from users. These are toggleable via admin commands.
