# DiscordPyBot
This is the main branch for a small discord bot I'm working on.
This bot was initially in JavaScript, but now I'm switching it over to python

This bot uses the discord.py api in which the documentation can be found here:
    https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html


Notes:
    The bot will prompt the user for a token. This token is used for login and verification purposes on the discord client.
    The token is stored in a token.dat file. Temporary login is an option that is prompted, but this isn't recommended since discord tokens are only able to be viewed once on the devportal.
